**id** | **string** | The ID of the high-performance routing network which is generated when the network is created. Use this ID to reference the high-performance routing network for further use. The ID can be uninitialized. An uninitialized ID indicates that the requested high-performance routing network is already existing. In this case a HighPerformanceRoutingNetworkAlreadyAvailableLimitation is created. It may contain the ID of the already existing high-performance routing network. Otherwise an unitialized ID in the HighPerformanceRoutingNetworkAlreadyAvailableLimitation indicates that the user has requested a high-performance routing network which has been delivered with the map. | [optional]
