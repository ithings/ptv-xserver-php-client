 * @description Describes the type of maneuver to execute.    * &#x60;START&#x60; - Denotes the departure at an OnRoadWaypoint.    * &#x60;START_LEFT&#x60; - Denotes the departure at an OffRoadWaypoint to begin the route to the left.    * &#x60;START_RIGHT&#x60; - Denotes the departure at an OffRoadWaypoint to begin the route to the right.    * &#x60;ARRIVE&#x60; - Denotes the arrival at an OnRoadWaypoint.    * &#x60;ARRIVE_LEFT&#x60; - Denotes the arrival at an OffRoadWaypoint if the waypoint is on the left.    * &#x60;ARRIVE_RIGHT&#x60; - Denotes the arrival at an OffRoadWaypoint if the waypoint is on the right.    * &#x60;CONTINUE&#x60; - Indicates to follow the current road. Usually such a maneuver occurs when the road attributation changes although the road goes straight.    * &#x60;KEEP_STRAIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to stay on the straight lane. This is usually in fork-shaped intersections with more than two spikes.    * &#x60;KEEP_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to keep left or to take the left lanee. This usually occurs in Y-shaped intersections.    * &#x60;KEEP_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to keep right or to take the right lane. This usually occurs in Y-shaped intersections.    * &#x60;TURN_HALF_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to turn half left at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;TURN_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to turn left at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;TURN_SHARP_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to turn sharp left at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;TURN_HALF_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to turn half right at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;TURN_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to turn right at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;TURN_SHARP_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to turn sharp right at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;MAKE_U_TURN&#x60; - Indicates to make a U-turn. Either at the same road or at structurally separated roads. The ManeuverEvent.relativeDirection indicates whether to turn left or right.    * &#x60;TAKE_ROUNDABOUT_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to enter a roundabout to the left and leave it at the given roundaboutExit. Only drivable roads of the roundabout are counted.    * &#x60;TAKE_ROUNDABOUT_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to enter a roundabout to the right and leave it at the given roundaboutExit. Only drivable roads of the roundabout are counted.    * &#x60;TAKE_COMBINED_TRANSPORT&#x60; - Indicates to take a railferry or a ferryboat. There is no direction available in this case.    * &#x60;ENTER&#x60; - Indicates to enter a highway/freeway/major road straight.    * &#x60;ENTER_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to enter a highway/freeway/major road to the left.    * &#x60;ENTER_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to enter a highway/freeway/major road to the right.    * &#x60;EXIT&#x60; - Indicates to leave a highway/freeway/major road straight.    * &#x60;EXIT_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to leave a highway/freeway/major road to the left.    * &#x60;EXIT_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to leave a highway/freeway/major road to the right.    * &#x60;CHANGE&#x60; - Indicates to change straight to another highway/freeway at an interchange.    * &#x60;CHANGE_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to change to the left to another highway/freeway at an interchange.    * &#x60;CHANGE_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to change to the right to another highway/freeway at an interchange.
