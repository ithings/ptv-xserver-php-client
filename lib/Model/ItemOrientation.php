/**
 * ItemOrientation Class Doc Comment
 *
 * @category Class
 * @description Enumerates possible orientations. This is the full set of orientations that can lead to a unique shape of a cuboid object. Note that as only the shape is considered, things like whether an item is upside down have no influence on its orientation in this model. While we named the orientations, it might be simpler thinking of them as discrete orientations with no deeper meaning.    * &#x60;ORIGINAL&#x60; - Items is not re-oriented. Dimensions stay (x,y,z).    * &#x60;X&#x60; - Item is rotated around x-axis (widthwise) by +/-90 degrees compared to the original orientation. Dimensions are (x,z,y).    * &#x60;Y&#x60; - Item is rotated around y-axis (heightwise) by +/-90 degrees compared to the original orientation. Dimensions are (z,y,x).    * &#x60;Z&#x60; - Item is rotated around z-axis (lengthwise) by +/-90 degrees compared to the original orientation. Dimensions are (y,x,z).    * &#x60;XZ&#x60; - Item is rotated around x- then z-axis (width- then heightwise) by +/-90 degrees compared to the original orientation. Dimensions are (z,x,y).    * &#x60;YZ&#x60; - Item is rotated around its y- then z-axis (length- then heightwise) by +/-90 degrees compared to the original orientation. Dimensions are (y,z,x).  Hint: Corresponding enum in xServer API documentation - com.ptvgroup.xserver.xload.ItemOrientation
