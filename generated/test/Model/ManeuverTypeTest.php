Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;TURN_HALF_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to turn half right at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;TURN_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to turn right at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;TURN_SHARP_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to turn sharp right at a crossing where at least one additional trailing road exists. Usually this occurs at T- or X-shaped crossings on urban or country roads. Even if the name of the turning road does not change a maneuver will be created.    * &#x60;MAKE_U_TURN&#x60; - Indicates to make a U-turn. Either at the same road or at structurally separated roads. The ManeuverEvent.relativeDirection indicates whether to turn left or right.    * &#x60;TAKE_ROUNDABOUT_LEFT&#x60; - Indicates to enter a roundabout to the left and leave it at the given roundaboutExit. Only drivable roads of the roundabout are counted.    * &#x60;TAKE_ROUNDABOUT_RIGHT&#x60; - Indicates to enter a roundabout to the right and leave it at the given roundaboutExit. Only drivable roads of the roundabout are counted.    * &#x60;TAKE_COMBINED_TRANSPORT&#x60; - Indicates to take a railferry or a ferryboat.
