 * @description Define all available emission types    * &#x60;HBEFA_3_2&#x60; - The emission calculation based on the Handbook of Emission Factors for Road Transport (HBEFA). HBEFA 3.2 calculation reports values for all global warming gases and other harmful substances. The internal process is independently certificated and therefore is independent of any external organizations.    * &#x60;HBEFA_4&#x60; - The emission calculation based on the Handbook of Emission Factors for Road Transport (HBEFA). HBEFA 4 calculation reports values for all global warming gases and other harmful substances. The internal process is independently certificated and therefore is independent of any external organizations.    * &#x60;EMISIA_COPERT_AUSTRALIA_1_2&#x60; - The emission calculation based on the Computer Program to calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT). The COPERT Australia emission calculation reports values for CO2 and fuel consumption.    * &#x60;EN16258_2012&#x60; - The emission calculation according to the European CEN standard (EN16258).    * &#x60;FRENCH_CO2_DECREE_2011_1336&#x60; - Emission calculation according to the French CO2 decree uses various calculation factors for the average fuel consumption of a vehicle. Only the following biofuel blends are supported: E10, E85 and B30. These blends can be set using the VehicleParameters FUEL\\_TYPE and BIO\\_FUEL\\_RATIO.    * &#x60;EN16258_DEFRA_2014&#x60; - The emission calculation based on the emission factors provided by the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs (Defra) in the United Kingdom , factors 2014.    * &#x60;AUSTRALIAN_NGA_FACTORS_2015&#x60; - The emission calculation based on the Australian National Greenhouse Accounts (NGA), factors 2015. To specify the emission class and the year of manufacture for each vehicle.    * &#x60;FRENCH_CO2E_DECREE_2017_639&#x60; - Emission calculation according to the 2017 French CO2E decree uses various calculation factors for the average fuel consumption of a vehicle. Only the following biofuel blends are supported: E10, E85 and B30. These blends can be set using the VehicleParameters FUEL\\_TYPE and BIO\\_FUEL\\_RATIO.
