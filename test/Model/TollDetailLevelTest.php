/**
 * TollDetailLevelTest Class Doc Comment
 *
 * @category    Class
 * @description Specifies the detail level for toll features.    * &#x60;BASIC&#x60; - Only basic toll summaries for a route and its legs are supported, as well as the routingprofile.Toll.tollPenalty to avoid or prefer toll roads. Not supported is the detailed toll information for a route including toll costs and toll systems, and the toll events. Rendering of toll roads is also not supported.    * &#x60;DETAILED&#x60; - Detailed toll information is supported: besides the toll summaries also detailed information about the toll costs, toll systems, and toll events along the route are supported. The routingprofile.Toll.tollPenalty to avoid or prefer toll roads supports vehicle dependency. Rendering of toll roads is supported as well.    * &#x60;MIXED&#x60; - The map is composed of countries at different detail levels. Only used for the complete map, not for a country or a subdivision.    * &#x60;UNSPECIFIED&#x60; - The detail level is unknown. This is probably the case when the map version is newer than the xServer version and contains unsupported data.  Hint: Corresponding enum in xServer API documentation - com.ptvgroup.xserver.xruntime.TollDetailLevel
