/**
 * JobStatusTest Class Doc Comment
 *
 * @category    Class
 * @description Specifies different job status values.    * &#x60;QUEUING&#x60; - Job has been enqueued.    * &#x60;RUNNING&#x60; - Job is currently running.    * &#x60;STOPPING&#x60; - Stop has been requested, the job will terminate its calculation as soon as possible.    * &#x60;SUCCEEDED&#x60; - Job has completed successfully.    * &#x60;FAILED&#x60; - Job has failed with an exception.    * &#x60;DELETED&#x60; - The job was deleted by the user.    * &#x60;UNKNOWN&#x60; - The job is in an unknown state. For example a given ID is unknown or the job has already been fetched and has therefore been deleted from the underlying persistent store.  Hint: Corresponding enum in xServer API documentation - com.ptvgroup.xserver.jobs.JobStatus
