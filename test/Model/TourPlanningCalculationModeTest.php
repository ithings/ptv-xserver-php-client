 * @category    Class
 * @description Enumeration to define the calculation behaviour of the algorithm, i.e. if the focus of calculation is on performance, quality or both.    * &#x60;PERFORMANCE&#x60; - The algorithm&#x27;s focus is on performance. A smaller search space for solutions is considered during the computation.    * &#x60;STANDARD&#x60; - The algorithm chooses a standard trade-off between quality and performance of the algorithm.    * &#x60;QUALITY&#x60; - The algorithm&#x27;s focus is on high solution quality. A larger search space for solutions is considered during the computation.    * &#x60;AVOID_INTERSECTIONS&#x60; - The algorithm&#x27;s focus is to avoid intersections of legs. Note that the number of planned vehicles may be higher compared to the results of the calculation modes performance, standard and quality, especially for requests with many restrictions such as disjoint opening intervals. A larger search space for solutions is considered during the computation.    * &#x60;CUSTOM&#x60; - The algorithm&#x27;s focus is adapted to the customer&#x27;s needs. It is necessary to define the custom calculation mode configuration accordingly.    * &#x60;EVALUATE&#x60; - The algorithm does not plan anything. A response is generated for all input tours of the request&#x27;s input plan without changing these tours.
