 * @description Indicates due to what reason a route violation occurs.    * &#x60;PROHIBITED&#x60; - The violated segment is prohibited in general for the current vehicle. See road attribute &#x27;prohibited&#x27;.    * &#x60;DELIVERY_ONLY&#x60; - The violated segment is prohibited except for delivery reasons but delivery is disallowed for the current vehicle. See road attribute &#x27;deliveryOnly&#x27;.    * &#x60;URBAN&#x60; - The violated segment is prohibited because it is flagged as urban. See road attribute &#x27;urban&#x27;.    * &#x60;RESIDENTS_ONLY&#x60; - The violated segment is prohibited because it is flagged as residents only for the current vehicle. See road attribute &#x27;residentsOnly&#x27;.    * &#x60;RESTRICTED_ACCESS&#x60; - A point with restricted access, e.g. a gate or a bollard was passed.    * &#x60;FEATURE&#x60; - The violated segment has an attribute from some enabled Feature Layer theme which prohibits to pass with the current vehicle (e.g. a weight or height restriction).    * &#x60;COMBINED_TRANSPORT&#x60; - The violated segment is a ferry or a piggyback prohibited for the current vehicle.    * &#x60;PROHIBITED_BY_INTERSECTING_POLYLINE&#x60; - The violated segment is prohibited by an intersecting polyline.    * &#x60;UNSPECIFIED&#x60; - Fallback value to be substituted for enumeration values which were added in an API version that is newer than the request version.
