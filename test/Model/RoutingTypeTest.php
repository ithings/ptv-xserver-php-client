/**
 * RoutingTypeTest Class Doc Comment
 *
 * @category    Class
 * @description Represents the type of the route calculation algorithm. It can be used as input parameter or the type is reported, for instance as part of a distance matrix calculation.    * &#x60;CONVENTIONAL&#x60; - Route calculation based on a standard algorithm. Heuristic elements are used to improve performance. If this element is used as input it the routing is forced to use the conventional algorithm.    * &#x60;HIGH_PERFORMANCE_ROUTING_WITH_FALLBACK_CONVENTIONAL&#x60; - This element is used only as input. It indicates that the service tries to use a high-performance routing network, and if no adequate data is found conventional routing is used instead.    * &#x60;HIGH_PERFORMANCE_ROUTING&#x60; - High-performance route calculation based on pre-calculated, profile-dependent additional routing networks. If it is used as input and no such network which fits the current profile settings is available an exception is thrown.  Hint: Corresponding enum in xServer API documentation - com.ptvgroup.xserver.routing.RoutingType
